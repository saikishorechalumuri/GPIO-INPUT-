# GPIO-INPUT PROJECT 3-
GPIO Input:  FUNCTION 3:  Whenever SW1 is pressed RED LED is ON, whenever SW2 is pressed GREEN LED is ON. 
Assign breakpoints after if condition and click run button in debugger window. Whenever SW1/SW2 presses program stops at any one of the breakpoint. 
FUNCTION 4  :  Use “WAKEUP SWITCH” and declare “counter” global variable. Your program should increment counter by one, every time switch is pressed.
Note how the value of counter changes on each “WAKEUP SWITCH” press. Use debugger and add Counter to “Watch Expression” window.
Does the value of counter increment by one always? Note: Define counter as a global variable and in debug perspective use continuous refresh option (You will find Continuous Refresh button on top of the Expression Window). You can use step debugging or breakpoints to check the variable value. Hint: To add variable to Expression Window, select and right click the variable name and select “Add Watch Expression”. To view Expression Window, click on View button from Keil menu bar and select Expressions. 
FUNCTION  5:  Whenever WAKEUP SWITCH is Press toggle RED LED. 
FUNCTION  6:  Read WAKEUP SWITCH, if switch is press RED LED is ON otherwise RED LED is OFF. Note that RED LED should remain ON for the duration switch is kept pressed i.e. RED LED should turn OFF when switch is released.
FUNCTION  7:  Whenever WAKEUP SWITCH Press turn ON BUZZER up to 250msec and Turn OFF BUZZER.
